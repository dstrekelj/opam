# OPAM - A package manager for OCaml

OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple simultaneous
compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a Git-friendly development
workflow.

OPAM was created and is maintained by [OCamlPro](http://www.ocamlpro.com).

To get started, checkout the [Install](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
and [Usage](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html) guides.

## Compiling this repo

* Make sure you have OCaml and GNU make installed. If you don't have a recent
  enough version of OCaml (>= 3.12.1) at hand, see the next section.
* Run `./configure`
* Run `make lib-ext` as advertised by `./configure` if you don't have the
  dependencies installed. This will locally take care of all OCaml dependencies
  for you (downloading them, unless you used the inclusive archive we provide
  for each release).
* Run `make`
* Run `make install`

This is all you need for installing and using opam, but if you want to use the
`opam-lib` (to work on opam-related tools), you need to link it to installed
libraries, rather than use `make lib-ext` which would cause conflicts. It's
easier to already have a working opam installation in this case, so you can do
it as a second step.

* Make sure to have ocamlfind, ocamlgraph, cmdliner, jsonm, cudf,
  dose 3.2.2+opam and re >= 1.2.0 installed. Or run `opam install
  opam-lib --deps-only` if you already have a working instance. Re-run
  `./configure` once done
* Run `make libinstall` at the end

## Developer mode

If you are developing OPAM, you may enable developer features by including the
`--enable-developer-mode` parameter with `./configure`.

Developer features are controlled by setting additional environment variables:

* `DEVELOPER_CACHE` - specifies the location of a directory to use for storing all
  downloaded files. This directory must exist or OPAM will ignore the setting. See
  the code for really_download in src/repository/opamDownload.ml for more details on
  how this feature operates.

## Compiling on Native Windows

```
BUILDING ON WINDOWS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL EVOLVE!
```

Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe - x86 recommended; x86_64 not yet
tested) is always required to build OPAM on Windows. Correct compilation requires
both a 64-bit and 32-bit C compiler in order to build opam-putenv. OPAM on Windows
requires OCaml 4.02 or later.

The following Cygwin packages are required:
* From Devel - `make`
* From Devel - `patch` (not required if OCaml and all required packages are
                        pre-installed)
* From Interpreters - `m4` (unless required packages are pre-installed or built
                            using `make lib-ext` rather than `make lib-pkg` - `m4`
                            is required by findlib's build system)
* From Archive - `unzip` (not required if OCaml is pre-installed)
* From Devel - `mingw64-i686-gcc-core` & `mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core` (not required if
                                                                 building with MSVC)
* From Mail - `procmail` (*recommended* only: required for parallel compilation of
                          lib-ext or win-zips)
* From Web - `wget` (do **not** install curl)
* From Net - `rsync`

Alternatively, having downloaded Cygwin's setup program, Cygwin can be installed
using the following command line:

`setup-x86 --root=C:\cygwin --quiet-mode --no-desktop --no-startmenu --packages=make,mingw64-i686-gcc-core,mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core,m4,patch,unzip,procmail`

The `--no-desktop` and `--no-startmenu` switches may be omitted in order to create
shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu respectively. Executed this way, setup will
still be interactive, but the packages will have been pre-selected. To make setup
fully unattended, choose a mirror URL from https://cygwin.com/mirrors.lst and add
the --site switch to the command line
(e.g. `--site=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/sourceware.org/pub/cygwin/`).

It is recommended that you set the `CYGWIN` environment variable to
`nodosfilewarning winsymlinks:native`.

Cygwin is started either from a shortcut or by running:

```
C:\cygwin\bin\mintty -
```

OPAM requires various commands from Cygwin in order to function correctly - ensure
that `C:\cygwin\bin` is in your `PATH` either by running
`set PATH=%PATH%;C:\cygwin\bin` or by adding `;C:\cygwin\bin` to `PATH` in the
System applet.

It is recommended that OPAM be built outside Cygwin's root (so in `/cygdrive/c/...`).
From an elevated Cygwin shell, edit `/etc/fstab` and ensure that the file's content
is exactly:

```
none /cygdrive cygdrive noacl,binary,posix=0,user 0 0
```

The change is the addition of the `noacl` option to the mount instructions for
`/cygdrive` and this stops from Cygwin from attempting to emulate POSIX permissions
over NTFS (which can result in strange and unnecessary permissions showing up in
Windows Explorer). It is necessary to close and restart all Cygwin terminal windows
after changing `/etc/fstab`.

OPAM is able to be built **without** a pre-installed OCaml compiler. For the MSVC
ports of OCaml, the Microsoft Windows SDK 7 or 7.1 is required
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=8442 - either x86 or x64
may be installed, as appropriate to your system). With the SDK, it is not necessary
to modify PATH, INCLUDE or LIB - OPAM's build system will automatically detect the
required changes. Other recent versions of Visual Studio will work, but will, at
this time, require manual configuration of PATH, INCLUDE and LIB.

If OCaml is not pre-installed, run:
```
make compiler [OCAML_PORT=mingw64|mingw|msvc64|msvc|auto]
```
The `OCAML_PORT` variable determines which flavour of Windows OCaml is compiled -
`auto` will attempt to guess. As long as `gcc` is **not** installed in Cygwin
(i.e. the native C compiler *for Cygwin*), `OCAML_PORT` does not need to be
specified and `auto` will be assumed. Once the compiler is built, you may run:
```
make lib-pkg
```
to install the dependencies as findlib packages to the compiler. Building `lib-pkg`
requires the ability to create native symbolic links (and the `CYGWIN` variable
*must* include `winsymlinks:native`) - this means that either Cygwin must be run
elevated from an account with administrative privileges or your user account must be
granted the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege using Local Security Policy. It is also
necessary to use a version of the OCaml Unix which is patched for PR6120 (the
version built using `make compiler` includes this patch) to provide correct support
for `Unix.stat` and `Unix.lstat` to ocamlbuild. Alternatively, you may run
`configure` and use `make lib-ext`, as advised.

You can then `configure` and build OPAM as above.

## Git-for-Windows

Git-for-Windows may be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/download/win. The default
selection of components is sufficient for OPAM. You should select `Use Git from the
Windows Command Prompt` and allow `core.autocrlf` to be set to `true`. The default
behaviour to use `MinTTY` for Git Bash is recommended, though not required for OPAM.

## Compiling without OCaml

`make cold` is provided as a facility to compile OCaml, then bootstrap OPAM.
You don't need need to run `./configure` in that case, but
you may specify `CONFIGURE_ARGS` if needed, e.g.:

```
make cold CONFIGURE_ARGS="--prefix ~/local"
```

NOTE: You'll still need GNU make.
